Mastermind game for Odin Project

main.rb is a simple menu where you get to choose wether you want to crack the code or create the code for the computer to crack.
crack_the_code.rb and create_the_code.rb are standalone and perform what their names suggest.

Instead of colors you will be using 1,2,3,4,5,6. 

so a simple code would be 

	1,2,3,4
	2,3,3,3
	6,4,1,1

You can also check the AI code cracking performance by uncommenting the section in create_the_code.rb located at the bottom of the file.

Have fun!
